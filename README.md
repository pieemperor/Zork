# Zork

This project was my final project in my 2nd Intro to Computer Science class.

This project is supposed to be similar to the game Zork. This project randomly generates a dungeon with different monsters and
weapons in the rooms. It also randomly assigns where the dungeon's exit is. The objective of the game is to make it through
the dungeon without dying. This project uses abstract classes and inheritance.
